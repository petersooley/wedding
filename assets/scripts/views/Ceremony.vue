            <h1>A different kind<br/>of ceremony</h1>
            <p>
                Heavy on the celebration and light on the rituals. <br/>&nbsp;
                No aisle. No sermon. No alter. <br/>&nbsp;
                Just the people we love and plenty of food, drink, and games.
            </p>
        </header>
        <div class="image main"><img src="images/peterryankiss.gif" alt="" /></div>
        <p>
            This is a celebration of love and commitment. We're just starting out
            on this journey and along the way it will be you, our friends and family,
            who will keep us accountable and inspired. So for this ceremony we have
            no one person who will guide us into marriage. It will be all of you.
        </p>
        <p>
            We want to hear your counsel on love, commitment, growing old together,
            and sharing life's milestones and crises. Share your thoughts on the
            relationship that we have, but also delve into your own experiences.
            What made you stronger? What lessons were learned?
        </p>
        <p>
            We'd like everyone who wants to speak get a chance, so your story should
            be short (like shorter than a song). For the less long winded or
            extroverted, we'd like to hear from you too. Even if you have a small
            one-liner to share that'd be fine. We can also just read something you write.
        </p>
