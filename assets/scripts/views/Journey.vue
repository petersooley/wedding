            We don't need knife sets, toasters, cheese boards, and other wedding bric-a-brac where we're going.
            After the plane tickets, we're going to the ever affordable Thailand. Where they have some gorgeous resorts
            and the beachiest beaches. All we need is a beach and nothing to do.
