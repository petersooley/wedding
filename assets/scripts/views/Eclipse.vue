            On August 21st, 2017, the sun and the moon will align casting a shadow over American soil
            for the first time since 1979. Can there be a more unique way to celebrate our marriage
            than to experience the strange effect of these two orbs as they tango through
            the galaxy?

            The Monday after the wedding, the eclipse first blesses the Oregon coast before
            moving westward. It's a narrow path and the full effect won't be visible from Portland.
            We and people all over the Pacific Northwest will be making a celestial pilgrimage
            to the "path of totality" for that Monday morning. Everyone is welcome to join
            the caravan on our way to the Salem area where we will ponder the whole of space and
            time in a few odd and breathtaking moments.
