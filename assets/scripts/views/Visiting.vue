            Some of you are traveling from far away -  we're so happy you're coming!
            Welcome to Oregon! Here are some tips for getting around. Portland is
            divided into quadrants: Southwest, Northwest, Southeast, and Northeast.
            There is a ton of stuff to do here! Just pick a quadrant and you're bound
            to find fun restaurants, bars, and parks within walking distance. You'll
            find it's pretty easy to get around town without a car.
        </p>
        <h3>Clothing</h3>
        <p>
            It will be hot! Please dress for warm weather and cool nights. It typically
            gets in the 90s during the day and the 60s at night. Portland is also a casual
            city, so don't feel any pressure to dress up. It's got that west coast vibe.
        </p>
        <h3>Lodging</h3>
        <p>
            There are a lot of <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/" target="_blank">Airbnb</a> options in the
            area or <a href="https://www.hipcamp.com/" target="_blank">Hipcamp</a> if you're looking for
            something more rustic. The wedding will be 45 minutes southeast of Portland,
            so the southeast side of Portland will be closest. You probably won't find
            anything near the park itself. If you have a question, just ask us! :)
        </p>

        <h3>Food</h3>
        <p>
            In case you didn't know, Portland's kind of a foodie city. We have some of the
            best food around and it's not really that expensive. If you're paying 15+ a meal
            in town, you're paying too much. There is an abundance of amazing cuisine in Portland.
            Don't eat at a chain! There is probably something better around the corner. Here are
            a few of our favorites:
        </p>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Place</th>
                    <th>Description</th>
                    <th>Cost</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><a href="http://www.bollywoodtheaterpdx.com/" target="_blank">Bollywood Theater</a></td>
                    <td>Indian street food</td>
                    <td>$$</td>
                </tr>

                <tr>

                            Food carts on SE 28th and Division
                        </a>
                    </td>
                    <td>All types of food!</td>
                    <td>$</td>
                </tr>

                    <td><a href="https://www.sizzlepie.com/" target="_blank">Sizzle Pie</a></td>
                    <td>The best (and strangest) pizza you'll ever eat!</td>
                    <td>$$</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <h3>Transportation</h3>
        <p>
            Our <a href="https://trimet.org" target="_blank">public transport</a> is easy and fairly cheap.
            It goes almost everywhere in the area, and you can even take the train to and
            from the airport. We also have <a href="https://www.lyft.com/" target="_blank">Lyft</a> or
            <a href="https://www.car2go.com" target="_blank">Car2Go</a> and a great taxi company
            called <a href="http://radiocab.net" target="_blank">Radio Cab</a> (veteran owned!). There
            are also peer-to-peer car rental services too that might be cheaper than a regular
            car rental like <a href="https://www.getaround.com/" target="_blank">Getaround</a> and
            <a href="https://turo.com/" target="_blank">Turo</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Wilderness</h3>
        <p>
            If you're new to the Pacific Northwest, you may want to step out of the city and
            check out the <a href="http://traveloregon.com/" target="_blank">natural wonders</a> around here.
            If you don't want to get too far out of the city, there's also
            <a href="http://www.forestparkconservancy.org/forest-park/" target="_blank">Forest Park</a>.
